# Other notes

* Better design could have been achieved using RXJS merge to return nested data
* Could not match font to design
* Used Cypress for e2e test instead of Protractor. It works but test is not very useful.
* There are no unit tests
* Limited amount of interfaces types
* More could be done on responsive features to make it more inline with design

# Installation

* run `npm i`
* run `ng serve`
* goto `http://localhost:4200`
* to run e2e test use `./node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open`
